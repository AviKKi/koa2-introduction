    :star1: or watch :watch: this repo as I'm still adding more content, or to appreciate my work.

### What is Koa.js 
Koa is a small and fast web framework made by developers of ExpressJS. With support for ES5-ES8 async functions will save you from callback hell. It is minimalistic framework so features like router, ORM, template engine are implemented by using 3rd party middlewares.


## Structure of repo
This repository has several folders, each folder is a tutorial with code in it and instructions in `README.md` file at root of that folder.
#### How to read these tutorials??
- Smoother way

Read this `README.md` file, then navigate to each folder increasing order, implement all the code reading the tutorials.

- The hard way

If you have experience with backend libraries like Express or Flask, clone this repo, go into each folder run the code(`yarn install` and `yarn dev`) and tweak around, code is very minimalistic so you'll figure out most of the things.
